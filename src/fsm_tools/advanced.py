"""
This Python implementation focuses on the formalization of automata, designed to adhere to Chomskyâ€™s grammar
hierarchy. The code implements different types of automata corresponding to the levels of formal languages:
**Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)** for regular languages, **Pushdown Automata (PDA)** for context-free languages,
**Linear Bounded Automata (LBA)** for context-sensitive languages, and **Turing Machines (TM)** for recursive
languages. The goal is to provide a flexible and modular approach for processing, simulating, and transforming these
automata.

By implementing this, we can explore how automata relate to formal language theory and the classification of languages
from regular to recursively enumerable. This tool can be expanded for educational purposes or used as a basis for
building more complex compilers or language processors.

class TuringMachine(Automaton):
    """
    Represents a Turing Machine (TM), a type of automaton capable of simulating any algorithm.
    It extends the base `Automaton` class to incorporate specific attributes and operations
    needed for Turing Machine computation. The machine operates on a tape and has the ability
    to read, write, and move the head along the tape based on predefined rules.

    This Turing Machine is specifically associated with the processing of **Type 0 languages**,
    which are also known as **recursively enumerable languages**. Type 0 languages represent the
    most general class of languages in the Chomsky hierarchy, which includes all languages that
    can be recognized by a Turing Machine. These languages are not necessarily decidable, but they
    can be enumerated by a machine that may not halt for all inputs.

    Attributes:
        tape (list): The tape (or tape array) that the Turing Machine operates on. Each cell in
                     the tape contains a symbol from the alphabet. The tape is considered
                     infinite in both directions, and its cells are initially filled with the blank symbol.
        head (int): The position of the read/write head on the tape. The head moves left or right
                    based on the machine's transition rules.
        register (str): The current state of the Turing Machine. This is used to determine the
                        next action based on the current state and the symbol under the head.
        blank (str): The blank symbol, representing an empty or uninitialized tape cell.
        moves (str): Defines movements allowed to the Turing Machine. Default moves allowed are forward (**F**) and
                     backward (**B**). Turing Machines may have more than 2 movements.
        state (dict): A dictionary that stores the accept and reject states of the Turing Machine.
                      The machine halts when it enters the accept or reject state.

    Methods:
        step(self):
            Executes one step of the Turing Machine based on the current state and the symbol under
            the head. The machine transitions to a new state, writes a symbol, and moves the head.
            The transition is determined by the current state and symbol, based on the rules defined
            in `self.grammar.rules`.

        get_rules(self):
            Returns the list of current rules or transition actions. These rules are associated with
            the grammar of the Turing Machine.

    Associations:
        - The `self.grammar.rules` attribute will contain the set of transition rules for the Turing Machine.
          Each rule is typically represented as a tuple or structured action that includes:
          - The current state (`state_from`)
          - The current symbol being read (`symbol`)
          - The next state to transition to (`state_to`)
          - The symbol to write on the tape (`write_symbol`)
          - The direction to move the head (`L` or `R` for left or right).

        - `self.grammar.alphabet`: The alphabet of the Turing Machine includes both the symbols that the
          machine can read from and write to the tape, as well as the blank symbol. Each symbol in the tape
          should belong to this alphabet.

        - `self.grammar.states`: The set of states includes the machineâ€™s current state and any states involved
          in transitions. The accept and reject states are also included, and the machine halts when it reaches
          one of these states.

        - `self.grammar.rules`: A list of rules that define the machine's behavior. Each rule maps a pair of
          current state and symbol to a next state, symbol to write, and head movement direction.

    Additional Parameters:
        - The blank symbol (`blank`) is used to represent an empty tape cell. This is an important
          concept for Turing Machines, as it defines the boundary of the non-empty portion of the tape.
          The blank symbol is added to the alphabet and used throughout the computation.

        - `state`: The dictionary that holds the names of the accept and reject states. These are crucial for
          halting the machine when the computation is finished or when the input is rejected.

    Notes:
        - Turing Machines are associated with **Type 0 languages** (recursively enumerable languages) in the Chomsky
          hierarchy, which are the most general class of formal languages. Type 0 languages include all languages
          that can be recognized by a Turing Machine, regardless of whether they are decidable or not.

        - A Turing Machine can perform unbounded computations on an infinite tape, making it capable of recognizing
          languages that are undecidable but still recursively enumerable.

        - The transition rules (`self.grammar.rules`) are crucial to the functionality of the machine, as they
          define how the machine progresses through its states based on the current symbol on the tape.

        - The machine halts when it enters either the accept or reject state, signifying that the computation
          is complete or that the input is rejected.

        """
        Adds a transition rule to the Turing Machine's transition table. This rule defines
        what the Turing Machine should do when it encounters a specific symbol in a given state.

        A transition for a Turing Machine includes the following components:

        - The current state (`state_from`): The state the machine is in before performing the action.
        - The current symbol (`symbol`): The symbol that is under the machine's read/write head (can be of any type).
        - The next state (`state_to`): The state the machine should transition to.
        - The symbol to write (`write_symbol`): The symbol to be written on the tape (can be of any type).
        - The direction to move (`move_direction`): The direction in which the head should move after writing the symbol ('L' for left, 'R' for right).

        These components align with the formal components of a Type-0 grammar (recursively enumerable grammar):

        - The **states** of the machine correspond to the non-terminals in the grammar.
        - The **symbols** under the head correspond to the terminals in the grammar.
        - The **transition rules** themselves can be considered as production rules in the grammar that specify how non-terminals (states) interact with terminals (symbols).

        This method adds the transition to the Turing Machine's internal transition table, which is stored in `self.grammar.rules`.
        The rules can be seen as a form of production that modifies the state and the tape contents.
