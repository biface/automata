Finite State Machines
---------------------

A Finite State Machine (FSM) or Finite State Automaton (FSA) is a mathematical model used to describe systems that can
be in a finite number of states. It is commonly used to recognize regular language or Type 3 language in the Chomsky
hierarchy.

An FSM can be a :

    * Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) when each state and input symbol lead to exactly on state
    * Non-deterministic Finite Automaton (NFA) when a state and input symbol may lead to multiple states or none
